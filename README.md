**ACCOMPLISHMENTS / PROJECTS**

 - Assessed vulnerabilities and exploits through white box testing of WordPress plugins and their updates
 - Lead, assembled, and trained multiple security analyst teams.  Kept stakeholders involved and reprioritized whole team's direction as needs changed
 - Spearheaded proactive threat research efforts - finding, identifying, capturing, completely unknown and active malware in the wild
 - Prototyped company's first convolutional ML classifier for malware analysis
   - Uses alternative source code analysis approach instead of raw binary data, employs regression training for node weighting
 - Led major drives for improvement:
   - lead team strategy and priority
   - initiated, designed, and conducted team training initiatives
   - wrote numerous internal scripts and solutions, documenting everything
 - Wrote a JavaScript automatic synchronization framework for software dev
   - Detected changes to registered variables with Underscore.js and Backbone.js
   - used JSON schema to define: classes, registered variables, merging protocols
   - Used function generators to attach triggers for function-driven merging behavior
     - Variables, classes, and functions all defined by developer leveraging framework - none of the properties existed until use
   - Allowed asynchronous changes and merging of data on reconnection
     - Designed for decentralized tracking/merging with no core repo
 - Wrote JavaScript/C# video games for fun
   - Prototyped dozens of games over weekend contests in a rapid dev cycle
