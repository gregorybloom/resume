**ACCOMPLISHMENTS / PROJECTS**

 - Led major drives for improvement: detection recall, signature optimization, team strategy and priority, training initiatives, documentation, script writing, prototyping the company's first neural network classification attempts
 - Wrote a thousand-plus detection signatures for hundreds of thousands of web malware files
   - Served the entire Endurance International Group space, then for the world's largest WordPress security plugin
   - Lead, trained, and documented the processes for teams that would continue this work
   - These signatures and their style may still be the body of detection for PHP, JS malware and webspam
 - Assembled and trained multiple teams for malware identification, signature authorship, and vulnerability patching
 - Prototyped a convolutional neural network classifier for malware analysis
   - Renders source code into AST, employs regression training for node weighting
 - Wrote JavaScript/C# videogames for fun
